# classification-challenge
Week 13 Challenge
This weeks challenge had us apply the learnings of the different types of classification methods for supervised learning.  We used two - one being Logistic Regression which is good for binary data, and then also a type of ensemble classification - Random Forest which creates multiple decision trees to model the data and predict the data.  Because I was out with Covid, I reviewed all the classess via the zoom recordings, completed the activities and then referenced them to complete this challenge on my own.
